Named Groups are the lynchpin for persisting RM21 models in Microstation dgn files.  

Names of named groups mirror the grouping hierarchy.  Code will ensure that named groups which have hierarched names have the same hierarchical relationship in their microstation relationships.

The name delimiter is the colon character, ':'    .

All RM21-generated and owned named groups begin with RM21.

The second level of a named group name is the corridor name.  So a corridor named "US-70" would be represented by all of the graphical dgn elements in the named group 
RM21:US-70

In this kind of case (which will be the most common), the name of the Corridor's baseline Horizontal Alignment is the same as the name of the corridor.

But RM21 allows for there to be horizontal alignments that are not affiliated with Corridors.  In this case, the named group name has two colons, as in
RM21::Flyover1

Features are to be clarified in this document as they are discovered and implemented in the software.
